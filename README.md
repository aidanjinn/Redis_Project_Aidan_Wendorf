# Redis_Project_Aidan_Wendorf
A personal project to create a redis from scratch in C/C++. I'm currently reading and following textbooks and documentation as I continue to work on this project.

Compile Redis:
````
    g++ -Wall -Wextra -O2 -g 03_server.cpp -o server
    g++ -Wall -Wextra -O2 -g 03_client.cpp -o client
````

Running Redis:
````
    ./server
    ./client
````
